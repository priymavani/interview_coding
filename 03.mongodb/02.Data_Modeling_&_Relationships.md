# SECTION B: Data Modeling & Relationships

<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Required Collections</summary>

## 1. Embedded Author Example
```javascript
{
  name: "Priy Mavani",
  age: 25,
  books: [
    { title: "MongoDB Guide", year: 2023 },
    { title: "Express.js Tips", year: 2024 }
  ]
}
```

## 2. Referenced Author Example
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("64a123456789abcdef012345"),
  name: "Priy Mavani"
}
```

## 3. Books Collection (Referenced)
```javascript
{
  title: "MongoDB Guide",
  year: 2023,
  authorId: ObjectId("64a123456789abcdef012345")
}
{
  title: "Express.js Tips",
  year: 2024,
  authorId: ObjectId("64a123456789abcdef012345")
}
```

## 4. Students Collection (Many-to-Many)
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("64b111111111111111111111"),
  name: "Rahul",
  courseIds: [
    ObjectId("64b2222222222222222222211"),
    ObjectId("64b2222222222222222222212")
  ]
}
```

## 5. Courses Collection (Many-to-Many)
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("64b2222222222222222222211"),
  title: "React.js"
}
{
  _id: ObjectId("64b2222222222222222222212"),
  title: "Node.js"
}
```

## 1. Design a One-to-Many Relationship using Embedded Documents
### Example:
One **Author** has multiple **Books** embedded inside.
```js
db.authors.insertOne({
  name: "Priy Mavani",
  age: 25,
  books: [
    { title: "MongoDB Guide", year: 2023 },
    { title: "Express.js Tips", year: 2024 }
  ]
})
```
**Explanation:**  
Embedded documents are stored inside the parent document.  
This is efficient when:
- Sub-data is always queried with the main document.
- The number of sub-documents is small and bounded.

üî• **Advantage:** No need for joins, faster reads.

## 2. Design a One-to-Many Relationship using References
### Example:
An Author refers to multiple Books via IDs.
```js
// Insert author
db.authors.insertOne({
  _id: ObjectId("64a123"),
  name: "Priy Mavani"
})

// Insert books referencing the author
db.books.insertMany([
  { title: "MongoDB Guide", year: 2023, authorId: ObjectId("64a123") },
  { title: "Express.js Tips", year: 2024, authorId: ObjectId("64a123") }
])
```
**Explanation:**  
References store ObjectIds pointing to another collection.  
Useful when:
- Sub-documents are large.
- Sub-data is reused in other relationships.

‚ö° **Advantage:** Better for scalability, reduces duplication.

## 3. Design a Many-to-Many Relationship using References
### Example:
Students can enroll in multiple Courses, and Courses can have multiple Students.
```js
// students collection
db.students.insertOne({
  _id: ObjectId("stu1"),
  name: "Rahul",
  courseIds: [ObjectId("course1"), ObjectId("course2")]
})

// courses collection
db.courses.insertMany([
  { _id: ObjectId("course1"), title: "React.js" },
  { _id: ObjectId("course2"), title: "Node.js" }
])
```
**Explanation:**  
Many-to-many is modeled by keeping arrays of references in both collections.  
Optionally, use a third enrollments collection for normalized form.

## 4. Choose Between Embedding vs Referencing

| Feature | Embedding | Referencing |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Query Performance | Faster for nested reads | Slower due to separate fetch or $lookup |
| Data Size | Good for small, bounded sub-documents | Preferred for large or unbounded sub-documents |
| Updates | Single document update | May require multiple updates |
| Reusability | Not reusable | Can be reused in multiple documents |
| Use When... | Always fetched together | Fetched or updated separately |

‚úÖ **General Rule:**
- Embed when relationship is 1:Few and data is always needed together.
- Reference when relationship is 1:Many or Many:Many with large/independent data.

## 5. Using .populate() in Mongoose vs $lookup in Native MongoDB

### ‚úÖ .populate() in Mongoose (Node.js)
```js
// Book Schema
const BookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Author' }
})

// Query with populate
Book.find().populate('author').exec((err, books) => {
  console.log(books)
})
```
**Explanation:**  
.populate() automatically joins referenced documents by replacing ObjectId with actual data.  
Easy and cleaner in Mongoose-based apps.

### ‚úÖ $lookup in Native MongoDB
```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "authors",               // foreign collection
      localField: "authorId",        // field in books
      foreignField: "_id",           // field in authors
      as: "authorDetails"            // output field
    }
  }
])
```
**Explanation:**  
$lookup is used in aggregation pipeline to perform joins.  
Provides more control and is powerful for advanced queries.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Difference: .populate() vs $lookup

| Feature | .populate() (Mongoose) | $lookup (Native MongoDB) |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Environment | Node.js/Mongoose | MongoDB Shell / Compass |
| Syntax | Simpler and automatic | More manual, flexible via pipeline |
| Performance | Slightly optimized by Mongoose | Pure MongoDB, more control |
| Use Case | Ideal for Node apps | Ideal for aggregation-heavy queries |
